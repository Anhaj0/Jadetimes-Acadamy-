            Throughout their time at New York Film Academy, students are a part of a close-knit community of filmmakers, visual artists, screenwriters, and performers who build connections through mentoring. Students work closely with our faculty of professionals who pass on accrued knowledge, techniques, and methods, as well as insight into new industry standards. Our instructors and staff consist of film directors, actors, screenwriters, and other active industry professionals with a passion for teaching and inspiring students to challenge themselves and expand their creative, technical, and intellectual skills.

We open our doors to students with varying educational and professional experience, facilitating a unique community of like-minded artists with a shared passion for storytelling. We encourage our students to come together to share knowledge and find new ways to innovate and excel in the art of storytelling.
